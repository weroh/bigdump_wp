# bigdump_wp
Based on BigDump ver. 0.36b from 2015-04-30 

Original Script at https://www.ozerov.de/bigdump/

This version of BigDump was built to be a really stupid way to quickly dump massive Wordpress Databases into the DB. Make sure your .sql file and wp-config.php file are all in the same directory. Make sure you delete bigdump_wp.php AND your .sql file after import or an attacker can revert or destroy your database lol.

Made with zero warranties. Enjoy at your own risk. Thanks.
